- **Real-time Detection**: Continuous face detection while camera is active
- **Bounding Boxes**: Visual feedback with face detection rectangles

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Features
- All data remains locally in the browser
- No external data transmission
- Camera access requires explicit user permission
- Data can be cleared by clearing browser storage

### Data Backup
- Export data regularly using CSV/Excel export
- Manual backup of localStorage data recommended

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera Not Working**
